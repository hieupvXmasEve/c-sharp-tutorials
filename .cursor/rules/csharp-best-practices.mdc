- Use C# 10+ features like record types and pattern matching where appropriate
- Prefer LINQ and lambda expressions for concise collection operations
- Use 'var' for implicit typing when the type is obvious
- Implement proper null handling using nullable reference types
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations to improve responsiveness
